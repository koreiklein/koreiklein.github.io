Today I thought about marketing and whether or not it is good.

I for a long time have had many reasons why it's not good.
I spent today enumerating the reasons why it is good.
Basically, they all come down to "maketing provides valuable information".
Marketing let's people know what merchants sell things that they might want, so they
don't have to waste time figuring it out for themselves.
I'm too lazy to explain those reasons here now.  I'll save them for
a treatise on marketing/advertising which I will later write.
