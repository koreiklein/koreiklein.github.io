Welcome to Korei Klein's personal tech blog. This is where I post pieces of writing that discuss
software, technology, logic, data and related topics.

I have a few reasons for writing these posts.  For one, I'm hoping that they'll draw some attention
to me and to the software I work on.  They're also genuinely meant to be useful.  I'm doing my best
to write about things that I know about and that I figure other people would want to read.  Lastly,
I like going through the process of writing an idea down so that I better understand my own thinking on it.

Some background on me: I've always been drawn to technical problems related to logic, software and data.
I spent a good deal of time studying abstract mathematics, computer science and formal logic.  For work, I've
spent most of my career writing and maintaining algorithms for complex real-world tasks.  My two favorite
real-world projects are a python library for designing/synthesizing libraries of DNA molecules for use in
biological experiments and a suite of backend software for optimizing the placement of inventory in a fulfillment
network, along with operational software that guides warehouse operators through the process of moving that inventory
around. My favorite not-so-real-world project is a software library for interacting theorem proving and synthesizing
usable software from the resulting proof.... that problem, however, is super hard and none of my work on it
is of any practical value (yet).  I love teaching people technical topics, and I spent a few years working as a software
engineering manager and enjoyed it.
